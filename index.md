# Hi there 👋
My name is Leah. I am a statistician and data scientist passionate about using machine learning to unlock hidden potential in data. My approach is deeply rooted in understanding the theoretical aspects of machine learning technique and using this to fit the right solutions to your data, not the other way around. I am excited to continue applying my skills, developing myself in data science / machine learning, and creating real-world impact! 

When I am not working on my projects, you can find me line dancing, reading about ancient cultures, or practicing my German.
