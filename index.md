# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Leah. I am a statistician and data scientist passionate about using machine learning to unlock hidden potential in data. My approach is deeply rooted in leveraging the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning technique to customize the solution to the data, not the other way around. I am excited to continue applying my skills, developing my data science / machine learning repetoire, and creating real-world impact

When I am not working on my projects, you can find me line dancing, reading about ancient cultures, or practicing my German!

# Projects ðŸ’¡
## [Greco-Roman CNN Image Classification](https://github.com/lashebir/grecoroman-imageclassification)
  - Deployed an image classification model in TensorFlow/Keras to categorize classical art by depicted deity across mediums
  - Designed a custom data pipeline to label, resize, and augment model training image data
  - Achieved **89% accuracy**; presented model output and visual summaries to support interpretability for stakeholders
    
## [Germanâ†’English Seq2Seq Transformer](https://github.com/lashebir/de-en-translator)
  -  Built a translation model using a custom Seq2Seq Transformer architecture in PyTorch for sentence-level prediction
